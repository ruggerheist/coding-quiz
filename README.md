# CODING QUIZ

## Description

For this project, I was tasked to create a quiz using JavaScript functions, arrays, and elements. The majority of the elements were dynamically created in JavaScript, which although creates its own set of challenges, allowed me to render the questions and options parallel to the html. This was definitely one of the more challenging projects to date.

## Usage

This is a quiz utilizing dynamic elements created in JavaScript. The questions are pulled from an array within JavaScript with each questions options and corresponding buttons being rendered by the code. The 30 second timer will not be effected by correct answers, however a wrong answer will subtract 5 seconds. If the user does not finish within the 30 seconds, the quiz will end. If the user finishes the quiz with time left, their score is compiled by adding the number of correct answers to the time remaining. A top 5 leaderboard, utilizing local storage, is perpetual and existing leaderboard spots can be overridden if the users score is high enough.
